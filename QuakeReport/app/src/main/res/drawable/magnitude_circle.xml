<!-- By defining the circle shape in XML, we create a single flexible asset that will scale across
     devices instead of including multiple image assets from our designer. We can also manipulate the
     color from Java code, further reducing the number of required assets. Fewer image files in our
     project means the size of our app will be smaller, which is better for the end user!  -->
